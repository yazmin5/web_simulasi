# Web Simulation for Covid-19 Spreading in Indonesia

## Introduction
This repository contains web application for the simulation of Covid-19 spreading in Indonesia, in particular Greater Jakarta Area (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi), East Java Province, West Java Province, and Bali Province. This web application simulate human movement in the spread of Covid-19 Using PageRank Algorithm, EpiRank Algorithm, and Distance Decay PageRank (DDPR) Algorithm.

## How It Works
This web application will receive the origin-destination matrix file as an input. The origin-destination matrix describes human movement in a certain area. The file will be computed using certain algorithm. Every region in the area will have the PageRank/EpiRank/DDPR score. This score show the center of human movement in a certain area. The larger the score, the more human come to that area. The more human come to that area, the more the spreading risk of Covid-19.
